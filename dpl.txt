Q8
Distributed System
A distributed system is a system that consists of multiple independent computers or nodes that work together to achieve a common goal, typically over a network. These nodes can be located in the same physical location or geographically distributed. The key feature of a distributed system is that it allows the computers or nodes to collaborate and function as a unified system, despite being separate entities.
Key Characteristics of a Distributed System:
1. Multiple Nodes (Machines)
•	A distributed system involves more than one physical machine or node that communicates and coordinates with each other.
•	Each node has its own processor, memory, and storage.
2. Transparency
•	Transparency in a distributed system means that users and applications are not aware of the underlying distribution of resources. They should be able to access the system as if it were a single entity.
o	Location Transparency: Users do not need to know the location of resources.
o	Replication Transparency: Users are unaware of the replication of data.
o	Concurrency Transparency: Users do not have to manage multiple processes accessing the system simultaneously.
o	Failure Transparency: The system should mask failures and continue functioning.
3. Fault Tolerance
•	A distributed system should be resilient to failures. If one node fails, the system should continue to function by redistributing work among other available nodes.
•	Replication and redundancy are key techniques for achieving fault tolerance.
4. Scalability
•	Distributed systems can scale by adding more nodes to handle increased load or to expand capacity.
•	Horizontal scaling (adding more machines) is commonly used in distributed systems.
5. Concurrency
•	A distributed system involves multiple processes running simultaneously on different nodes. These processes may need to share data or coordinate actions, and thus, concurrency is an essential feature.
•	Synchronization is required to handle concurrent access to shared resources.
6. Communication
•	Nodes in a distributed system communicate with each other over a network, which could be local (within a building) or global (across data centers or geographies).
•	Communication is typically done using standard protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, or RPC (Remote Procedure Call).
7. Coordination and Synchronization
•	Distributed systems need mechanisms to coordinate and synchronize activities across different nodes. This includes managing shared resources, ensuring consistency, and handling mutual exclusion (when multiple nodes try to access the same resource).
•	Techniques like distributed locks, message passing, and leader election are commonly used for synchronization.
8. Data Distribution and Replication
•	Data is often distributed across multiple nodes, and replication is used to ensure data availability and fault tolerance.
•	Distributed databases, for example, often split data into shards and store them across multiple nodes, with copies (replicas) to prevent data loss.
Types of Distributed Systems:
1. Client-Server Systems
•	In this model, clients request resources or services from a server. The server handles the requests and provides responses.
•	Example: Web applications, where clients (browsers) request data from servers.
2. Peer-to-Peer (P2P) Systems
•	In P2P systems, each node (peer) acts both as a client and a server. Peers communicate directly with each other without a centralized server.
•	Example: File-sharing networks like BitTorrent.
3. Cloud Computing Systems
•	Cloud systems are highly distributed systems that provide on-demand resources (computing power, storage, etc.) over the internet.
•	Example: Amazon Web Services (AWS), Google Cloud, and Microsoft Azure.
4. Distributed Databases
•	A distributed database system involves databases that are spread across multiple locations. The data is distributed, often replicated, across different nodes.
•	Example: Cassandra, MongoDB, and Google Spanner.
5. Microservices Architecture
•	In microservices, applications are broken down into small, independent services that communicate with each other. Each service can be deployed, scaled, and updated independently.
•	Example: An online shopping application where the user authentication, payment processing, and product catalog services are all separate services running on different machines.
Challenges in Distributed Systems:
1. Network Latency and Bandwidth
•	The communication between nodes in a distributed system can suffer from network latency (delay in communication) and limited bandwidth. This can impact performance, especially in large-scale systems.
2. Consistency and Concurrency Control
•	Maintaining data consistency (e.g., in replicated databases) is a key challenge, especially when different nodes may update the same data at the same time.
•	Distributed systems often face the CAP Theorem challenge: balancing Consistency, Availability, and Partition Tolerance.
3. Security
•	In distributed systems, securing communication and data across multiple nodes is complex. Encryption, access control, and authentication are critical.
4. Fault Detection and Recovery
•	Detecting and recovering from failures in a distributed system is challenging. Systems must be designed to detect when nodes fail and take appropriate actions to recover.
Applications of Distributed Systems:
•	Cloud Computing: Public and private clouds are essentially large-scale distributed systems.
•	Content Delivery Networks (CDNs): Distributed systems used to deliver content efficiently across a wide geographical area.
•	Big Data Processing: Systems like Hadoop and Spark distribute the processing of large data sets across many nodes.
•	Blockchain: A decentralized and distributed ledger technology used in cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin.
